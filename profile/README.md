# Easy Optimization
This mod pack focuses on one thing: optimization. It supports shaders, OptiFine zoom, and a clean UI.

## Important Info
Some of the mods in version 2.0.0 require an Nvidia GPU. To fix this, remove the Nvidium mod.

You may not get an FPS boost straight away. You may need to change settings for this to work as it should.
