# Easy Optimization
This mod pack focuses on one thing: optimization. It supports shaders, OptiFine zoom, and a clean UI. To get shaders or resource packs, you do not even have to leave the game! With the
'Resourcify' mod you can get them with ease.

## Important Info
Some of the mods in version 2.0.0 and higher require an Nvidia GPU. To fix this, remove the Nvidium mod.

You may not get an FPS boost straight away. You may need to change settings for this to work as it should.

I do **NOT** edit the settings of minecraft, you will need to make settings your self.
